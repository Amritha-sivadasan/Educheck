# Educheck

## Description
Educheck is an exam-based application designed like a quiz page. It starts with a dashboard that features a timer and presents questions with four options. The test duration is one hour, and students are required to complete at least 50% of the questions.


## Technologies Used

Educheck is built using a modern tech stack to provide an efficient and responsive user experience. The key technologies and libraries used in this project include:

- **Next.js 14**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Shadcn UI Library**: A component library designed for building user interfaces with ease.
- **Lucid React**: An icon library for scalable and customizable icons.





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
